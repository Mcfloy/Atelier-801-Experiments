# Atelier 801 Experiments
Fansite prototype allowing to have many features about the Atelier 801 games

# Installation
You can copy/paste the project in the root folder of your server, but actually there's no installation script, so the project is not fonctional actually (because you don't have the databse). But it'll come soon ^^
